# qamous al filaha
My encyclopedia on farming in lebanon since early 1900's.

I write in transliterated arabic, which is then converted to arabic characters to the folder `docs`, which gets published to
https://shadiakiki1986.github.io/qamous-al-filaha/

# Local usage
Other than the github pages publication, to run the jekyll server:

```bash
sudo apt install ruby-dev
gem install jekyll bundler
jekyll new diary
cd diary && bundle exec jekyll serve
# => Now browse to http://localhost:4000 
```
